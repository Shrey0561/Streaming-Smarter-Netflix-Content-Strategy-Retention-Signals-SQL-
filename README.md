# Streaming Smarter: Netflix Viewer Retention Analysis (SQL + Excel)
> This project simulates a real-world scenario: what a content analyst might uncover when exploring Netflix's catalog using only SQL.

## TL;DR
**Problem:** Netflix needs to understand what types of content drive global growth and viewer retention.

**Process:** Queried and cleaned **8,800+ titles** using SQL to analyze trends in genres, production countries, season longevity, and data quality.

**Result:** 
- Identified **Action & Drama** as globally scalable content
- Flagged data quality gaps (e.g., missing dates, inconsistent country labels)
- Highlighted **India and South Korea** as rising content producers

**Takeaway:** SQL-driven content analytics can guide smarter platform investments without advanced BI tools.
